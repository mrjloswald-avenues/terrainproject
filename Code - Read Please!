Hello User! Welcome to Alex's Bay Area Flood Simulator! Unfortunately, due to rising water levels, the Bay Area has been flooded, and so disaster management experts and computational geographers have been looking for a way to model these changes so as to come up with a solution. Thus this code focuses on simulating the Bay Area flooding problem; hopefully the guys can use this code to get closer to finding a solution!

print("Here's my explanation of the tilde symbol which I thought was cool to mention: The tilde (~) symbol in swift represents water or flooded areas in the simulation. In \"five four three tilde tilde tilde tilde three's\" example, it shows a partially flooded area.\nThe numbers (integers) represent a cell's elevations above water level, so five would mean that cell has an elevation of five.\nThe tildes at the middle of the numbers indicate that those specific areas are underwater.\nThat specific tilde function shows that the four cells represnted by tildes are flooded, or underwater.\nSo, keeping this in mind, as the water level rises, lower numbers will be replaced by tildes which ultimately represents the spread of flooding.")
